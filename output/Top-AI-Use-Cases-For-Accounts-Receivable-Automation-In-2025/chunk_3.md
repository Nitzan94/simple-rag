Five Accounts Receivable Use Cases Are
Ripe For AI Transformation
AI is transforming many aspects of the accounts receivable process, from managing
collections, payment notices, and deductions to e-invoice delivery and presentment
and cash application. The adoption of AI algorithms and models varies by use case, as

adoption. Vendors tend to invest in ML and predictive and prescriptive analytics.
